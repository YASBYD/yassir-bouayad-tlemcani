      <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
      <p>With over 16 years of experience in ground operations at RAMHANDLING, a subsidiary of Royal Air Maroc, I have built strong expertise in managing and optimizing ground handling operations. As a Black Belt Lean Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma AI Belt certified professional, I focus on improving efficiency, ensuring safety, and delivering exceptional passenger experiences.

My career includes collaborations with global airlines like Qatar Airways and Air France, Saoudi Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, Turkish Airlines, EL AL, Iberia, providing me with a deep understanding of international best practices.
A certified trainer by the General Directorate for Civil Aviation (DAC) and Active participation in the ISAGO audit, leading the process as a Flight Supervisor and later as a Station Manager, culminated in securing the ISAGO certificate for the Marrakech station, I am committed to maintaining the highest safety and operational standards while driving continuous improvement.
