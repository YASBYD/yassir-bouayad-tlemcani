  <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
  <p>Over my 16-year career in ground operations at RAMHANDLING, a subsidiary of Royal Air Maroc, I have held various roles within different departments at Marrakech Airport, ultimately reaching the esteemed position of Station Manager. My expertise lies in overseeing and optimizing Ground Handling operations with a strong focus on efficiency, safety, and industry compliance. I have a proven track record in leading multi-departmental teams, fostering collaboration, and achieving operational goals. Customer service excellence is at the core of my work, where I am dedicated to enhancing the passenger experience and satisfaction. Thriving in dynamic environments, I excel in problem-solving and adaptability, promptly addressing operational challenges. My profound understanding of aviation regulations ensures strict adherence to safety protocols and industry standards. As the Station Manager in Marrakech, I lead ground operations, manage expert teams, and ensure seamless service delivery. Introducing strategic projects to enhance operational efficiency and minimize turnaround times is a key aspect of my role. My experience extends beyond RAMHANDLING to Qatar Airways and Air France, Saoudi Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, Turkish Airlines, EL AL, and Iberia, where I worked as a Flight Supervisor before transitioning to the Station Manager position. This exposure provided me with a deep understanding of international aviation standards and procedures. Additionally, my involvement with Qatar Airways as an approved trainer reflects my commitment to continuous learning and professional development. Active participation in the ISAGO audit, leading the process as a Flight Supervisor and later as a Station Manager, culminated in securing the ISAGO certificate for the Marrakech station. As a certified trainer by the DAC (General Directorate for Civil Aviation), I am dedicated to meeting international safety and operational standards with precision.</p>
